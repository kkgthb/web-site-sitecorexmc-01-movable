- ID: "1230d2cb-4948-4d43-8a3b-b39978f6f1b3" # This GUID, and the included GUID values for it, keep showing up in disparate codebases.  Again, probably something SXA-related.  Some codebases have even more values, but this is the overlap.  Per https://www.sc-graphql-cookbook.dev/snippet/search---orderby, the included values are things like "SiteMetadata Site Collection Setup" and "Headless Navigation Site Collection Setup" ([http://localhost/en]/sitecore/system/Settings/Feature/JSS-Experience-Accelerator/Navigation/Headless-Navigation-Site-Collection-Setup)
