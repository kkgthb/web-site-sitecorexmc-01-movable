ID: "" # I get to make this value up myself
Parent: "825b30b4-b40b-422e-9920-23a1b6bda89c" # This value means "/sitecore/templates/Project".  If this file were meant to be displayed to authors as nested beneath another "Template Folder Definition Item," then its parent would be the ID of that one, and that one's parent would be the magic GUID displayed here.
Template: "0437fee2-44c9-46a6-abe9-28858d9fee8c" # This value means "Template Folder" -- as in, there's a "myfirstsitecollection" folder alongside this YAML file with YAML files inside of it that are typed as Template Folder, Template, etc.
