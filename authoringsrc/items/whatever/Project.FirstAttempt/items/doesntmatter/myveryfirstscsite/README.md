This is probably a good place for a `Home.yml` & `Home/` folder _(under which might appear "Agenda.yml&/," "Not Found.yml&/," "Sponsors.yml&/," "Venue.yml&/," "Workshops.yml&/," etc. if this were the Sugcon project)_.

* The `ID: ` GUID of `Home.yml`, `Home/Agenda.yml`, etc. will be `sitecore.route.itemId` in the Layout Service for `/`, `/Agenda`, etc.
* The `Template: ` GUID cross-reference within these .yml pages will be `sitecore.route.itemId` in the corresponding Layout Service data.
* I still have to figure out where `sitecore.route.layoutId` value comes from.
    * It looks like `e4e11508-04a4-4b0b-a263-5201f811c9cd` is another magic SXA GUID that your own layout YAML files _(e.g. whose `ID: ` GUID that you set appears here)_ can use as a `Template: ` value or something, though.
        * Tip:  to clump your own layout YAML files within the authoring UI, you can give them a parent, grandparent, etc. whose `Template: ` is `93227c5d-4fef-474d-94c0-f252ec8e8219` _([Layout Folder](https://github.com/Sitecore/Sitecore.Rocks/blob/master/src/Sitecore.Rocks/id.xml))_.  The topmost YAML file of all these Layout Folder Definition Items ancestors should be yet another Sitecore-builtin _(also a Layout Folder Definition Item)_ GUID of `10335194-8652-470a-9445-fd7c4fb21b4e` _("[Sitecore Platform Foundation Layout](https://github.com/Sitecore/Sitecore.Demo.Platform/blob/1691cebd27decf4c2a52f39670109325643caea7/src/items/Foundation.Serialization.Foundation.Layout/Foundation.yml#L4)"; it's already got a `Path: /sitecore/layout/Layouts/Foundation`)_
            * So, by the time you've created your own `Some Layoutey Filename.yaml` file whose ID mysteriously turns into `sitecore.route.layoutId`, it'll have `Path: /sitecore/layout/Layouts/Foundation/maybe a grandparent layout folder/maybe a parent layout folder/Some Layoutey Filename` in it, if you architect it this way.
