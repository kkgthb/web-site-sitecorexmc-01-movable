I have not actually yet written this codebase.

It's gonna take me forever to reverse-engineer other people's codebases configuring XM Cloud and guess how to write it as tiny as possible, since Sitecore for some inexplicable reason refuses to do a developer instance program like Sanity CMS, Salesforce, AWS, etc. do.

(Do they not _want_ people to have any confidence in XM Cloud before migrating to it?  Dudes.  Let developers Hello World properly.)
